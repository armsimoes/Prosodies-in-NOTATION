# Name of this project: Prosodies-in-NOTATION #
###############################################
#
# This project is designed as a software library to execute other libraries, functions, 
# plug-ins, etc. It works in combination with the notebook called 
# <Notebook_Prosodies_to_NOTATION.ipynb>, and the PANDAS Data Frame, through the 
# function <f0_extraction_to_dataframe>. Other files are used as audio examples.
#
# 	The <Notebook_Prosodies_to_NOTATION.ipynb> is a Python Notebook for f0 (pitch) extraction 
#       to produce the following outputs from sound # recordings: 
#	(1) an FFT oscillographic image (bidimensinal); 
#       (2) an FFT 3D static image (tridimensional; 
#       (3) an f0 plot; 
#       (4) automatic .csv files with measurements of musical notes associated with duration, f0, 
#           intensity (amplitude), f0 acceleration, intensity acceleration and other related 
#           parameters. These measurements in .csv files are meant to be imported from Excel 
#           for statistical analyses; 
#       (5) an FFT 3D dynamic image (tridimensional); and 
#       (6) a MIDI file to create musical notation in a music software and MIDI outputs through a 
# 	    MidiEditor. 
#
# NOTE: It is common to confuse pitch and fundamental frequency (f0). The f0 is the acoustical 
# equivalent of pitch. Pitch is perceptual. Pitch is what the human ear hears, it is what one 
# feels. In order to study sound pitch, it is necessary to extract the fundamental frequency.
